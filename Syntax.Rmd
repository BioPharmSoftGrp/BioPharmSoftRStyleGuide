## Assingment

## Semicolons

    # Good Examples
    x <- 5
    y <- 2

    x <- 5; 
    y <- 2; 
    z <- 3;

## Comments
    Comments should be meaningful and add understanding to the code.  If your code requires a comment for most lines, consider rewritting be clearer.  Utilizing naming conventions is helpful.  In addition, using orgnized files and creating functions for complex code blocks can be helpful.
